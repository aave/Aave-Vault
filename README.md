# Wrapped aToken Vault

An ERC-4626 vault which allows users to deposit/withdraw ERC-20 tokens supported by Aave v3, manages the supply and withdrawal of these assets in Aave, and allows a vault manager to take a fee on yield earned.

## Instructions

To compile/build the project, run `forge build`.

To run the test suite, run `forge test`.

## Tests

Some of the tests rely on an RPC connection for forking network state. Make sure you have an `.env` file in the root directory of the repo with the following keys and values:

```
POLYGON_RPC_URL=[Your favourite Polygon RPC URL]
AVALANCHE_RPC_URL=[Your favourite Avalanche RPC URL]
```

The fork tests all use Polygon, except tests for claiming Aave rewards, which use Avalanche. 

This test suite also includes a16z's [ERC-4626 Property Tests](https://a16zcrypto.com/generalized-property-tests-for-erc4626-vaults/), which are in the `ATokenVaultProperties.t.sol` file. These tests do not use a forked network state but rather use mock contracts, found in the `test/mocks` folder.
